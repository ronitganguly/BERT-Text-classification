# BERT-Text-classification
This small project shows the potential of fine-tuning the final layer of BERT and getting state-of-the-art model for text classification.

In the project, I am analysing the sentiments from the review text column.
As a result, if the ratings are above 3 then the review text reflects positivity, while if they are 3 or below, the review text reflects negativity.
